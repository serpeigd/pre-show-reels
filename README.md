Twistify is a movie app with a rule that's actually enforced, not just
promised: the plot never leaves the server until you say you've already
seen it. Underneath, an evaluation harness measures whether that promise
holds — with numbers, not a self-awarded green badge.

**Live demo:** [twistify.onrender.com](https://twistify.onrender.com)
(Render free tier — the instance spins down after 15 min idle, so the
first request after a while takes ~1 min to cold-start; that's expected,
not broken. It also wipes its filesystem on every redeploy/spin-down, so
comments and movie suggestions reset — see [Limitations](#limitations).)

## Try it in 2 minutes

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serpeigd/Twistify.git
cd Twistify
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" pydantic pyyaml
python webapp/app.py
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Pick a researched movie — 23 now (Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Get Out,
Parasite, The Prestige, Se7en, Arrival, Gone Girl, and 15 more), read the
spoiler-free entry, and when you're ready, open the curtain. The two
remaining measurement titles show a live TMDB poster/synopsis instead
(see [Browse tier](#browse-tier-tmdb)) — no API key needed for any of
this, `TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN` just upgrades those placeholders to real
posters.

## What makes this different from "another movie CRUD"

- **The spoiler partition is a server-side property, not a UI promise.**
  Post-viewing content isn't sent to the browser until the client declares
  `seen=true` — opening devtools reveals nothing. It's not CSS hiding a
  `<div>`.
- **Every factual claim says whether it has a source or not.** No faking
  `source_id`s when there's no real retrieval behind it. The gap is shown,
  not disguised.
- **The spoiler-leak detector itself is measured, not assumed.** There's an
  evals harness (`evals/`) that calibrates the judge against planted leaks
  and reports its real recall — including the uncomfortable case where the
  cheap judge fails (see [Results](#under-the-hood-the-evaluation-harness)).
- **Filters that actually mean something.** Themes (identity, obsession,
  class and power…) that group several movies for real, not a one-off tag
  per title.
- **Actually usable on a phone.** Below 760px the catalogue sidebar
  (search, filters, film list) is a hamburger-triggered off-canvas
  drawer — not the old `display:none` that forced "desktop site" mode to
  browse at all.
- **Scaling the researched catalogue automates the labor, not the
  citation bar.** `webapp/research_assist.py` (see
  [Research-assist tool](#research-assist-tool-scaling-the-researched-catalogue))
  drafts a new researched entry from real Wikipedia + TMDB retrieval, but
  every claim still needs a real source URL — a code-level sanitizer strips
  any citation the model invents, and a human review gate sits between a
  draft and `content/researched/` for the CLI workflow (one deliberate
  exception exists — see [Limitations](#limitations)).

## Stack

**Backend:** Python 3.12 · FastAPI · Pydantic v2 (typed data contracts, not
loose dicts) · pytest (evals harness, runs with no network, no API key)

**Frontend:** vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no framework, on purpose: the app is
small enough that a framework would be cost without benefit, not "doesn't
know how to use one."

**AI / evaluation:** Anthropic Claude (tool use / structured output for the
paid baseline generator) · Groq/Llama (free-tier alternative for the same
baseline generator, the `LLMJudge`, and the only model `research_assist.py`
uses — no Anthropic path exists there, so nothing in this project *requires*
a paid key) · a custom evals harness design (leakage / grounding / richness)
with a calibrated judge, verified against planted leaks and real human
spoiler reviews.

**Data sources:** TMDB (free, attributed — browse-tier posters/search,
research-assist metadata) · Wikipedia (CC BY-SA — research-assist
retrieval) · MyMemory (free — on-the-fly Spanish translation, cached) ·
Upstash Redis free REST API (optional — durable comments/movie-requests
on a redeploy; falls back to local files without it).

**CI:** green (see badge above) — `tests.yml` installs only
`pydantic`/`pytest`/`pyyaml`; every test needing `fastapi`/`groq`/`httpx`/
`scikit-learn`/`sentence-transformers` guards its own import with
`pytest.importorskip`, so CI runs 18 of the 35 tests and cleanly skips
the rest rather than failing collection (broken 2026-08-19–2026-08-30 —
two newer test files imported those packages directly; both now use
`importorskip` like every other optional-dependency test here). Locally,
with every dependency installed except `sentence-transformers`, 31 of
the 35 tests pass, 4 skipped; with that last package too, all 35 run.

## How it's built

| Piece | What it is |
|---|---|
| `webapp/app.py` | FastAPI + vanilla JS. Serves the catalogue, runs the spoiler gate, comments (edit/delete with no accounts, anonymous per-browser token). `GET /api/stats` exposes the same grounding/leakage numbers for auditing — deliberately *not* rendered on the page itself (an earlier "no leaks detected" badge was removed for the same reason `SubstringJudge`'s 0.0 recall is disclosed everywhere else: a green seal the measurement can't back up). |
| `webapp/research_assist.py` | Drafts a new researched entry from real Wikipedia + TMDB retrieval (never LLM memory) — see [Research-assist tool](#research-assist-tool-scaling-the-researched-catalogue). |
| `webapp/prewarm_translations.py` | One-time build step: caches Spanish translations of researched + browse-tier content so the live deploy never calls the translation API on a visitor's request. |
| `webapp/resolve_tmdb_ids.py` | One-time helper: resolves a `tmdb_id` for every title in `evals/dataset/titles.yaml` so the browse tier can show a poster for all 20. |
| `content/researched/*.json` | 23 cited entries: 8 hand-researched (Wikipedia, Hollywood Reporter, No Film School…) plus 15 drafted by `research_assist.py` — most human-reviewed before publishing, but one path isn't (see [Limitations](#limitations)). |
| `src/preshow/` | Data contracts (Pydantic) for both the researched content and the measurement harness, plus the TMDB/Wikipedia/translation/KV-store clients. |
| `evals/` | The real experiment: leakage/grounding/richness metrics, calibrated judge, 20-title stratified dataset, external calibration scripts. |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | Every non-trivial design decision (D1–D17) with its trade-off, written as it was made. |

## Status

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Twistify app (catalogue, spoiler gate, filters, comments) | ✅ 23 entries researched — 18/20 measurement titles plus 5 beyond that set |
| Browse catalogue (TMDB posters, live search, ES/EN) | ✅ posters for every title in the catalogue, search reaches all of TMDB |
| Offline evals harness | ✅ CI green (18/35 tests run there, rest skipped — no `fastapi`/`groq`/etc. installed); 31/35 pass locally, 35/35 with optional `sentence-transformers` too |
| Spoiler ground truth (20 titles) | ✅ 20/20, LLM-researched with cited sources (never hand-labeled — see [Ground truth, precisely](#ground-truth-precisely) below) |
| Baseline generator (no retrieval) | ✅ two providers — Anthropic (paid) and Groq (free tier, no card) |
| Judge calibration (offline + real spoiler reviews) | ⛔ **closed, unsolved** — six judges built and tested against real generator output; none clears the bar to trust a `leakage_rate`. `SubstringJudge` (recall=0.0) stays the default because its failure mode is bounded and known (see [Limitations](#limitations)) |
| Measure the baseline over the 20 titles | ✅ done — see numbers and caveats below |
| Research-assist tool (D14) | ✅ drafted 15 of the 23 researched entries so far (batch-promoted, human-reviewed); a separate, un-reviewed auto-publish path also exists — see [Limitations](#limitations) |
| Retrieval (Wikipedia, GREEN-only corpus) + `--generator retrieval-groq` | ✅ `grounded_fact_rate` 0.0→1.0 confirmed live, all 20/20 titles hand-read (D16) |

## Ground truth, precisely

The 20-title measurement set's spoiler labels are **LLM-researched with
cited sources** — an LLM reads real sources (Wikipedia, reviews, cast
interviews) and drafts what counts as a spoiler and how severe it is, with
every claim traceable to a citation. That is a different, weaker claim
than **"hand-labeled"**, and this README (like `docs/DESIGN.md`'s D7)
deliberately never uses the second phrase for the first thing: conflating
them would quietly reintroduce the same self-coherence risk the project's
judge-calibration work exists to catch. See D6/D7 in
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) for the full reasoning and the
trade-off that was made explicitly, not by default.

## Under the hood: the evaluation harness

The part you don't see in the screenshots is what backs the app's promise:
a system that **measures**, instead of promising, three things per entry:

1. **`leakage_rate`** — did any spoiler slip into the pre-viewing content?
2. **`grounded_fact_rate`** — how many claims carry a real source?
3. **`richness`** — how much does it actually say? (an empty output scores
   perfectly on the first two — that's why it's never reported without
   this one)

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q                            # 31/35 (35/35 with sentence-transformers too), no network, no API key -- CI runs a smaller 18/35 slice (only pydantic/pytest/pyyaml installed there) and is green
python evals/run_eval.py --generator baseline-groq    # free tier, no card
python evals/run_eval.py --generator baseline         # or the paid Anthropic version
```

### Milestone 0 results (no-retrieval baseline, Groq/Llama-3.3-70B, 20 titles)

| Metric | Mainstream | Long-tail | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|
| `leakage_rate` | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| `grounded_fact_rate` | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| `richness` (claims/case) | 6.0 | 6.0 | 6.0 |

**Read this table with its caveats, not instead of them:**

- **`leakage_rate = 0.0` is not a safety result — it's the judge's blind spot.**
  `SubstringJudge` was calibrated offline at **recall = 0.0**: it only catches
  verbatim spoiler phrases, never a paraphrase. A 0.0 leakage rate here most
  likely means the judge failed to see leaks that are actually there, not
  that the baseline is safe. Trusting this number without the calibration
  note next to it is exactly the mistake this project exists to avoid.
- **`grounded_fact_rate = 0.0` is a real, expected finding.** The baseline is
  given no retrieval corpus (`corpus=[]`) and is explicitly instructed never
  to invent a source id. Zero real sources in, zero real sources out — this
  is the quantitative baseline Milestone 1 (retrieval) needs to beat, not a
  bug.
- **`richness = 6.0`** confirms the generator isn't gaming the first two
  metrics by returning an empty brief.
- **Mainstream and long-tail are identical here**, which means this run
  *cannot yet confirm or deny* the project's original hypothesis (that a
  no-retrieval baseline degrades on long-tail titles) — a judge with 0.0
  recall can't see a gap that might exist. See below: this is no longer a
  missing-dataset problem, it's a judge problem.

### External judge calibration (IMDB Spoiler Dataset, real user reviews)

The calibration above uses the project's own LLM-written paraphrases —
useful, but it's an LLM checking an LLM. `evals/calibrate_substring_external.py`
re-runs it against real IMDb user reviews (Misra's IMDB Spoiler Dataset,
Kaggle, free), restricted to the 9 of our 20 titles the dataset covers
(mostly mainstream — long-tail titles here barely have review coverage at
all, a small real echo of the project's own mainstream/long-tail split):

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Reviews evaluated | 2,197 real spoiler-tagged + 5,460 real non-spoiler-tagged |
| **Recall** | **0.0** — caught 0 of 2,197 (95% CI: 0.0–0.002) |
| Precision | undefined (0 positive predictions made — not "wrong every time") |

**Same conclusion, now independently confirmed**: `SubstringJudge` doesn't
just fail on paraphrases it's never seen from itself — it fails on plain
human language, and with n=2,197 the 95% confidence interval (Wilson score,
`evals/stats.py`) is tight enough (0.0–0.002) that this isn't sample noise —
it's a structural miss. See D12 in `docs/DESIGN.md` for the one caveat this
comparison carries (a review can be a real spoiler for a plot point we
didn't document, which the method above counts as a miss even though it
isn't the judge's fault).

### `LLMJudge`, calibrated the same way (Groq free tier)

`evals/calibrate_llm_external.py` re-runs the exact same method against
`LLMJudge` (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`, Groq's free tier) instead of
`SubstringJudge`. Free-tier limits (1,000 requests/day, and every review
costs `len(that movie's labels)` calls) meant a smaller, seeded, stratified
sample — 180 reviews (20/title, balanced spoiler/not) instead of the full
7,657 — and review text truncated to 350 characters/call to stay under
the tokens/min cap:

| Judge | n | Recall (95% CI) | Precision (95% CI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SubstringJudge` | 7,657 | 0.0 (0.0–0.002) | undefined |
| `LLMJudge` (llama-3.1-8b-instant) | 180 | **0.089** (0.046–0.166) | 0.471 (0.262–0.69) |

A real improvement over the free floor — it sees paraphrases the substring
judge structurally cannot — but not yet trustworthy: it misses ~91 of every
100 real spoiler reveals in this sample, and fewer than half its positive
calls are right. The 95% confidence intervals (Wilson score interval,
`evals/stats.py`) matter here more than the point estimates: with only
n=180 (forced by Groq's free daily request cap), true recall could
plausibly be anywhere from 0.046 to 0.166 and true precision from 0.262 to
0.69 — a much bigger error bar than `SubstringJudge`'s, which had 42x more
data. Two things this run couldn't separate: whether that ceiling was the
small model or the 350-char truncation forced by the token budget.

**Follow-up: it was mostly the truncation.** Same model, same 180-review
sample, truncation raised from 350 to 1,500 characters:

| Truncation | n | Recall (95% CI) | Precision (95% CI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 350 chars | 180 | 0.089 (0.046–0.166) | 0.471 (0.262–0.69) |
| 1,500 chars | 180 | **0.356** (0.264–0.459) | **0.64** (0.501–0.759) |

Non-overlapping confidence intervals — a real, large effect. Truncating
reviews to 350 characters was hiding most of the model's actual recall.
Still not good enough to trust a `leakage_rate` on (0.356 recall still
misses ~64 of every 100 real spoilers), but meaningfully better than the
first run suggested.

**The remaining confound — does a stronger model help — is resolved: no,
barely at all.** After three free-tier failures (a daily token quota that
turned out to be a rolling window, and a transient Groq outage — see
D13's follow-up in `docs/DESIGN.md` for the full account), a complete run
of `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` at the same 350-char truncation as the
original baseline finished cleanly:

| Model | n | Recall (95% CI) | Precision (95% CI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| llama-3.1-8b-instant | 180 | 0.089 (0.046–0.166) | 0.471 (0.262–0.69) |
| llama-3.3-70b-versatile | 108 | **0.093** (0.04–0.199) | 0.714 (0.359–0.918) |

Recall is essentially flat — a model roughly 9x larger doesn't catch
meaningfully more real spoiler reveals. Precision looks better but the
CIs still overlap substantially. **Combined with the truncation result
above, this is a clean answer**: giving the judge more text mattered a
lot; paying for a bigger model didn't. `LLMJudge`'s ceiling at
reasonable free-tier settings looks to be around recall≈0.35–0.4 — a
conclusion about truncation vs. model size, not about a specific model
name: Groq decommissioned both `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and
`llama-3.1-8b-instant` on 2026-08-18, so these two are cited here as the
models that actually produced the numbers above, not as what to run
today (current default: `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b` for
the judge).

### A trained classifier beats every judge above

Two more approaches were tried (D15 in `docs/DESIGN.md`). A local NLI
(entailment) classifier failed outright — impractically slow on this
project's dev hardware, and even where it ran, its recall was ~0
(formal NLI entailment is a stricter bar than "could a viewer infer
this", a real task mismatch, not a bug). But training a small classifier
directly on this project's own external labels worked, and it's the
best judge calibrated so far:

| Threshold | Recall (95% CI) | Precision (95% CI) |
|---|---|---|
| 0.3 | **0.889** (0.876–0.902) | 0.357 (0.345–0.37) |
| 0.4 | 0.685 (0.665–0.704) | 0.45 (0.433–0.467) |
| 0.5 | 0.445 (0.424–0.466) | 0.571 (0.547–0.594) |

TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, trained on the **full** 7,657-review
external set (no free-tier sample-size limit), evaluated with grouped
k-fold by title (leave-one-title-out) so every reported prediction comes
from a model that never saw its own title during training — a genuine
held-out estimate, not a fit-and-report number. It beats `LLMJudge`'s
best result at every threshold from 0.4 down, with a far tighter
confidence interval. Per-title recall (0.285–0.668 across the 9 titles)
confirms it isn't just memorizing Fight Club, which is 32% of the
dataset. Caveats: trained only on the 9 mostly-mainstream titles with
review coverage, and it answers a different question than the other
three judges ("is this text spoiler-revealing" vs. "does it entail this
specific documented spoiler").

**Wired in**: `python evals/train_spoiler_classifier.py` persists the
trained model, and `python evals/run_eval.py --generator baseline-groq
--judge trained-classifier` uses it (default judge stays `substring`,
which needs nothing but the stdlib — this one needs the persisted model
plus `scikit-learn`). See D15 in `docs/DESIGN.md`.

**Validated in-domain, not just on IMDb reviews it was trained on**:
`evals/calibrate_trained_classifier_internal.py` tests it against real
spoiler-free pre-viewing text from the 8 hand-researched titles plus
this project's own 277 documented spoiler sentences — recall=0.838
(95% CI 0.79–0.876), precision=0.928 (95% CI 0.889–0.954) at the
shipped threshold, actually better than the external number.

**But it does NOT work on this project's actual generator output —
confirmed, not a theoretical risk.** The first live run
(`--generator baseline-groq --judge trained-classifier --show-leaks`)
scored **leakage_rate=0.95**, flagging things like a stage direction
("Black screen"), a cast credit ("The film stars Daniel Kaluuya..."),
and an award fact ("...won the Palme d'Or") as spoilers. The baseline
generators write short, fragmentary `on_screen_text`/`voiceover` lines —
a third register this judge was never trained or validated on (its
training data and validation set are both full sentences). Scoring the
flagged phrases directly showed every one landed in a narrow 0.30–0.47
band regardless of content — not a threshold problem, the model has no
real signal on fragments this short. `run_eval.py` now prints a warning
when `--judge trained-classifier` is selected; **don't report a
`leakage_rate` from it** until this is fixed. Full account in D15.

**Fix attempted, reduced but didn't solve it**: `--judge hybrid` routes
short text (< 15 words) to `SubstringJudge`, longer text to the trained
classifier. Live result: leakage_rate=0.6 (down from 0.95), but every
remaining flagged sentence was still a false positive — mood/theme/
production text, no real plot reveal — confirmed by scoring a
hand-invented neutral control sentence, which landed in the same noise
band. This classifier has no real signal on this generator's writing
register at any length tested.

**`--judge llm` tried too — same pattern.** A complete 20-title run
scored leakage_rate=0.8: release-year facts, director credits, and
marketing hooks ("Are you ready to have your mind blown?") all flagged
as core leaks. One catch looked genuinely plausible
(`sixth_sense_1999`), but it was a small signal in a lot of noise.

**Decision: stop iterating on judges.** `SubstringJudge` (recall=0.0, an
honest floor) stays the default; the others stay available for
comparison, none fit to report a real `leakage_rate`. Working hypothesis
instead: a `corpus=[]` generator has nothing real to write from, so it
defaults to vague "hints at something" prose that fools any
recall-favoring judge — not a judge problem, a grounding problem.
Milestone 1 (below) tests that directly.

### Milestone 1: real retrieval, GREEN-tier only (D16)

`src/preshow/retrieval.py` wires up the GREEN/AMBER/RED corpus-tagging
mechanism this project's schema was built for (`SourceDoc.tier`,
`PreShowBrief`'s own docstring: "Generated with GREEN context only") but
Milestone 0 never used. Fetches Wikipedia, returns only
`overview`/`production`/`accolades` as GREEN — the `plot` section is
never even constructed as a source, and `reception`/critical-response is
dropped too (real reviews discuss plot points). `--generator
retrieval-groq` uses it.

**Full 20/20-title result** (three infrastructure fixes were needed to
finish live on the free tier: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` for its larger
daily token budget, corpus truncation to stay under its tighter
per-minute cap, and call pacing + retry — see D16 in `docs/DESIGN.md`):
`grounded_fact_rate` went from 0.0 (Milestone 0) to **1.0** — a
judge-independent, purely structural result (every fact-kind claim now
cites a real source_id). `leakage_rate` measured 0.0 under
`--judge substring`, but that alone doesn't prove zero leaks (substring
can't see a leak pulled from the model's own memory rather than the
corpus) — what IS proven independent of any judge is that the corpus
itself never *constructs* a plot-section source to begin with.
`run_eval.py --save-briefs` writes the full generated text so a human
can check the remaining question directly, which is what found both
leaks below.

**Human spot-check, no judge involved, all 20 titles read: two
independent leak mechanisms found, both real.** All 5 highest-risk
titles (Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Se7en, The Prestige, Gone Girl) came
back clean — no twist revealed in any of them. But:

- **Los cronocrímenes** (longtail): the script said "his other selves,"
  matching this project's own documented core-spoiler paraphrase almost
  exactly. The retrieved corpus never mentions multiple selves — this
  came from the model's own memory, not the corpus.
- **Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Hard to Be a God**: both generated briefs
  stated their film's documented core/major spoiler almost verbatim
  ("human-machine transformation"; "cannot resist the urge to take a
  stand" against a non-interference order). This time the leak was
  **already present in the retrieved GREEN corpus itself** — Wikipedia's
  own `overview` paragraph, for films whose public premise already *is*
  the twist. A third title, Come and See, has the same risk sitting
  unused in its `production` section.

Two different failure mechanisms (model memory bypassing a clean
corpus; a "safe" corpus section that isn't actually safe for some
films), confirmed independently. Milestone 1 is a real, measurable
improvement — it isn't a solved problem, and this project explicitly
decided not to chase a per-section content filter for the second
mechanism, for the same reason judge iteration was closed below: a
heuristic filter would carry the same false-negative risk every judge
attempt already demonstrated, for a gap confirmed in 3/20 titles, not a
systemic failure.

**A sixth judge was built specifically to catch this — and also failed
live, closing the search.** `SimilarityJudge` compares generated text
against the SPECIFIC title's own documented spoiler paraphrases by
sentence-embedding cosine similarity, not literal matching. It genuinely
caught the Cronocrímenes leak (0.525 similarity vs. 0.035 for clean
text) after two other approaches failed on that pair (TF-IDF: 0.023, no
signal; NLI entailment: backwards, scored unrelated text higher), and
calibrated well offline: recall=0.87, precision=0.856 on the same
internal dataset as `SubstringJudge`'s own D7 calibration — better than
every other judge tried in this project. But a live run immediately
found a false positive ("The film stars Bruce Willis as a child
psychologist...", the film's own public premise) scoring **0.561** —
higher than the confirmed real leak's 0.525. No threshold separates
those two numbers.

**This was the sixth judge (Substring, LLM-external, NLI,
TrainedClassifier, Hybrid, Similarity) to fail on real generator
output.** Six independent technical approaches, six different failure
reasons, the same result — a strong enough signal to stop, not keep
trying a seventh. **Decision: judge iteration is closed.**
`SubstringJudge` (recall=0.0, an honest and bounded floor) stays the
only judge this project trusts for reporting a `leakage_rate`; the real
safety practice is `--save-briefs` plus a human reading the generated
text directly — which is what actually caught the one confirmed leak
this project has found. Full account in D16, `docs/DESIGN.md`.

The decisions behind this design (why there's no LangGraph, why the schema
allows invalid states on purpose, why the same model being measured can't
generate its own ground truth) are documented in
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Research-assist tool: scaling the researched catalogue

Hand-researching an entry (cited sources, no invented facts) takes ~15
minutes each — fine for 8 titles, not for the "most important films in
cinema history" the catalogue is meant to grow into. `webapp/research_assist.py`
automates the *labor* of that process, not the citation bar itself:

```bash
python webapp/research_assist.py "Citizen Kane" 1941
```

1. **Real retrieval, never LLM memory.** Fetches the film's Wikipedia
   article (`src/preshow/wikipedia.py`) and its TMDB metadata/director
   (`src/preshow/tmdb.py`), and gives the model *only* that retrieved text
   to draft from — the prompt explicitly forbids citing anything else.
2. **Best-of-3 drafting.** A single free-model call was inconsistent run
   to run (4–15 grounded claims from the same prompt against the same
   text — see D14 in `docs/DESIGN.md`), so `draft_best_of()` generates 3
   independent candidates from the same retrieved text and keeps the one
   with the most grounded, unfabricated claims.
3. **A code-level safety net, not just a prompt instruction.**
   `sanitize_grounding()` walks every citation in the draft and nulls out
   anything that isn't exactly a URL this run actually retrieved — it
   already caught the model inventing a plausible-looking Rotten Tomatoes
   URL in testing.
4. **Output never bypasses human review.** Drafts are written to
   `content/_drafts/` (gitignored), never straight to
   `content/researched/` — a human still has to read and promote a draft
   before it's published, same bar as the existing 8 entries.

**Status:** used to draft 15 of the app's 23 researched entries so far,
batch-promoted from `content/_drafts/` after human review — the same
gate the original 8 hand-researched entries went through. That review
caught a real problem, not just typos: 4 of 13 candidates in the first
batch stated a core/major spoiler directly in the spoiler-free `story`
field, traced to the script giving one LLM call both the plot text and
an instruction not to leak it — a genuine partition (a separate call
that's only ever given non-plot text) fixed 2 of the 4; the other 2
(Los cronocrímenes, Tetsuo) are still held back, and Tetsuo's own
Wikipedia overview states its premise-is-the-spoiler directly, which no
retrieval partition can fix. Needs `GROQ_API_KEY` (free).

**A second, separate path skips that gate entirely.** The live app's
"+ Suggest a movie" flow auto-publishes a `research_assist.py` draft
straight to `content/researched/` with no human or AI review step at
all — a deliberate, disclosed, knowingly-risky decision (see
[Limitations](#limitations)), not an oversight. See
[Roadmap](#roadmap) for what's next.

## Browse tier: TMDB

The 2 titles in the 20-title measurement set that aren't researched yet
(Los cronocrímenes, Tetsuo: The Iron Man) still show a real poster and
synopsis instead of an empty placeholder, and `/api/search` reaches
effectively all of TMDB — this is a deliberately separate, lower tier:
it never claims to be spoiler-safe
or cited the way `content/researched/*.json` is (see D10 in
`docs/DESIGN.md`). Needs `TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN`; without it, the app
still runs, it just shows the "not researched yet" placeholder instead of
a poster.

## Configuration

Everything in the [quickstart](#try-it-in-2-minutes) works with **zero
keys** — the demo app, its comments, and the offline evals harness
(`pytest tests/`) need nothing. Every key below is an optional upgrade,
never a requirement; all are read from a gitignored `.env` in the repo
root (`src/preshow/env.py`, falls back to the real environment too — no
`python-dotenv` dependency).

| Variable | Unlocks | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Browse-tier posters/search for the 2 not-yet-researched measurement titles (D10) | Free, [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | `--generator baseline-groq`, `LLMJudge` external calibration, `research_assist.py` | Free tier, no card, [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `--generator baseline` (Claude instead of Groq for the same baseline generator) | Paid — the *only* piece of this project that costs money, and it's opt-in |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Comments/movie-requests survive a redeploy on a free host with an ephemeral filesystem (D11) | Free, no card, [console.upstash.com](https://console.upstash.com) |

Full install, including the optional pieces:

```bash
pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" pydantic pyyaml pytest   # core app + harness
pip install groq httpx                                    # needed for the full test suite too (see Limitations) — also unlocks baseline-groq, LLMJudge calibration, research_assist.py
pip install anthropic                                     # optional: paid baseline generator only
```

## Roadmap

Documented as open, not started, in `docs/DESIGN.md`'s "Open questions"
and `CLAUDE.md`'s "Next task":

- **Judge iteration is closed, not solved** (D15/D16). Six judges were
  built and tested; none can be trusted to report a `leakage_rate`, and
  no seventh is planned. What replaced it is not another judge but a
  practice: `run_eval.py --save-briefs PATH` plus a human reading the
  generated text. That is what actually caught all three confirmed leaks
  in this project — no automated judge caught any of them.
- **Milestone 1 is complete** (20/20 titles run and hand-read) and
  **closed with two confirmed leak mechanisms documented rather than
  fixed** — see [Limitations](#limitations). A content filter over the
  GREEN corpus was considered and rejected for the same reason judge
  iteration was closed: it would carry exactly the false-negative risk
  every judge attempt already demonstrated. What comes after this
  milestone is an open choice, not a queued fix.
- **Research the remaining 2 measurement titles.** Los cronocrímenes is
  a normal case — `research_assist.py`'s output improved once its plot
  text was fully partitioned out of the pre-viewing call, just held back
  pending another review pass. Tetsuo: The Iron Man is not: its own
  Wikipedia overview states the film's premise-is-the-spoiler directly,
  so no retrieval partition can produce a synopsis that's both honest
  and safe — it needs a hand-written entry, the same way the original 8
  were done, or it stays out of the demo.
- **"+ Suggest a movie" is now automated, not pending.** It resolves a
  `tmdb_id` via TMDB autocomplete and auto-publishes a
  `research_assist.py` draft with no review step — a deliberate,
  disclosed risk rather than the missing piece it used to be (see
  [Limitations](#limitations)). Whether to add a review gate back for
  this specific path is the open question now, not whether to automate
  it.
- **Upstash on the live Render deploy** — deliberately deferred (the
  project owner's call, not a blocker): comments/movie-requests on the
  live demo reset on every idle spin-down until an Upstash account is
  wired in. The code path (D11) already handles this gracefully (empty
  state, not an error).

## Limitations

Stated plainly, not hidden behind a green badge — this is the project's
own stated goal applied to itself:

- **No spoiler judge in this project is trustworthy**, and no
  `leakage_rate` anywhere in this README should be read as a real safety
  measurement. Six were built and tested against actual generator output:
  `SubstringJudge` (recall = 0.0 — it only matches verbatim planted
  phrases), `LLMJudge`, `NLIJudge`, `TrainedClassifierJudge`,
  `HybridJudge`, and `SimilarityJudge`. Several calibrated well offline
  and then failed live, in the same direction every time: confidently
  flagging release years, cast credits, stage directions, and marketing
  copy as "core" spoilers. `SimilarityJudge` scored a film's own public
  premise (0.561) *higher* than the one confirmed real leak it was built
  to catch (0.525) — no threshold separates those. `SubstringJudge`
  remains the default not because it is good but because its failure
  mode is bounded and known: it misses things, rather than inventing
  them. Six independent failures, so judge iteration is closed (D15/D16).
- **Three real leaks are confirmed in Milestone 1's output, found by
  human reading and by no judge**, via two independent mechanisms:
  *Los cronocrímenes* ("one man must stop his other selves") came from
  the **model's own memory** — the retrieved corpus never mentions it —
  while *Tetsuo* and *Hard to Be a God* leaked because **Wikipedia's own
  `overview` section states those films' core spoilers verbatim**, so the
  "safe" GREEN corpus wasn't safe for them. *Come and See* has the same
  risk latent in its `production` section. Milestone 1's real result
  stands (grounding genuinely improved; the five highest-risk
  famous-twist titles all came back clean), but it is **not a leak-proof
  guarantee** — a context partition bounds what the model can read, not
  what it already knows.
- **`grounded_fact_rate = 0.0` on the Milestone 0 baseline is expected,
  not a bug** — that generator is given no corpus on purpose. Milestone 1
  beat it: 0.0 → 1.0, and that one is judge-independent (it only checks
  whether a `source_id` is populated).
- **The mainstream vs. long-tail hypothesis is unconfirmed.** Both strata
  scored identically in the Milestone 0 run — a judge with ~0 real recall
  can't reveal a gap that might genuinely exist.
- **`research_assist.py` has been run across many titles now, not just
  one** (15 of the 23 researched entries), but it still can't cite Rotten
  Tomatoes/Metacritic directly (no simple free API for either) — a real,
  disclosed gap against the 8 hand-researched entries, which do cite
  those sites directly.
- **"+ Suggest a movie" auto-publishes with no review step, unlike every
  other path into `content/researched/`** (see
  [Research-assist tool](#research-assist-tool-scaling-the-researched-catalogue)
  above for the leak that review step actually caught). An explicit,
  disclosed, knowingly-risky decision, not an oversight — see
  `webapp/app.py`'s module docstring.
- **The live demo's comments/movie-requests reset on idle spin-down**
  (Render free tier wipes the filesystem; Upstash isn't wired in yet —
  see [Roadmap](#roadmap)). Known and accepted, not a bug to chase.

## Sources and legal restrictions

- **TMDB** — free for non-commercial use, requires attribution (shown in the
  app wherever TMDB data appears). Powers the browse tier (`src/preshow/tmdb.py`
  — live search, catalogue posters), separate from the hand-researched,
  cited-source tier (see D10 in `docs/DESIGN.md`). Its terms restrict using
  the content to *train* AI systems; inference with attribution is the
  usual reading, but review it before scaling this up further.
- **OMDb** — a path to Rotten Tomatoes/Metascore scores, free tier is
  limited.
- **Wikipedia** — CC BY-SA, already in use for researched entries.
- **Scraping IMDb** — forbidden by ToS, not done under any excuse.

- **The IMDb Spoiler Dataset** used for judge calibration
  (`evals/dataset/external/`, gitignored) carries its own terms and is
